[How to Solve Programming Problems](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/)

- Common Mistakes that most programmers make when they are given a programming problem during an interview are:

  - Improper allocation of time

  - Start writing code right away

  - Trying to over solve the solution on the first iteration

- Simple Steps to follow for any algorithm type of programming problem (70% of your time should be spent on the first 3 steps):

  - Read the problem completely, twice.

  - Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.

  - Optimize the manual steps.

  - Write the manual steps as comments or psuedo-code.

  - Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.

  - Optimize the real code.

*Final tips* 

- If you follow this template for solving algorithm type problems, you should do very well in programming interviews, but you have to have confidence in the process.

- To have confidence in this process, you need to practice! It takes a lot of faith to believe that spending 70% of your allotted time just thinking about the problem and not writing any code. So make sure you have that faith when you need it.

- If you are given a large or very complicated problem, use the "divide and conquer" approach. Find a way to cut the problem directly in half and then follow the process on each half.

- *Busyness and Stress Are The Enemy*

  - Busyness is nothing more than distraction and procrastination from what really matters.

  - "Busyness and exhaustion should be your enemy. If you're chronically stressed and up late working, you're doing something wrong. Do Less. But do what you do with complete, hard focus. Then when you're done be done, and go enhoy the rest of your day." (Cal Newport - Deep Work)

  - Do you want incredible productivity? Then cultivate extreme focus with whatever you do.

- *As You Think, So You Are*

  - If you let people know your time is free and low-valued, people will treat it as such. But, if you teach people that your time is expensive, important, and valuable, then people will respond in kind.

  - "People are unhappy, in large part, because they are confused about what is valuable." (William Irvine)

  - If you don't treat yourself and your time with respect, you will become unhappy, resentful, and tired. Your body and mind long for mastery and freedom; you can't have those things if your time is cheap and easily taken.

- *You Can Do Amazing Things, But Only If You Have Time To Do Them*

  - "The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything." (Warren Buffet)

  - Every time you say yes to something, it means you're saying "no" to a dozen other opportunities. The world's most successful and extraordinary people say no to almost everything, but yes to a few things.

  - The process of weeding out the merely "good" for the truly great opportunities is easier when you value your time at $1000/hr. Anything you can honestly justify doing for $1000/hr is probably a good thing.

- [How to Think Like a Programmer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2/)

  - Problem solving is the meta-skill. Currently, you probably solve problems by trying a solution, if that doesn't work, try another one, then repeating until you get lucky. You might get lucky, but how about a better approach...

  - Having a framework for problem solving is more important than actual syntax knowledge. So here are the steps:

    - **Understand** - Know exactly what is being asked. Most problems are hard because you don't understand them. You should write down the problem, doodle a diagram, or tell someone else about it.

    - **Plan** - Don't dive right into solving without a plan. Plan your solution

    - **Divide** - Don't try to solve one big problem. Break it down into sub-problems. These are much easier to solve. Start with the simplest. Once you've solved all the sub-problems, connect the dots.

    - **Stuck** - The best programmers are more curious about bugs/errors than irritated. If you get stuck, try these three things:

      - Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong.

      - Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective.

      - Research: No matter what problem you have, someone has probably solved it. Go find the solution!

    - **Practice** - Don't expect to be great after just one week. If you want to be a good problem-solver, solve a lot of problems.
