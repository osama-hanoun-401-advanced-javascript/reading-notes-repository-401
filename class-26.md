## Component Based UI

- Component based UI systems like `React`, `Angular`, `Vue`, and the like all operate on similar architectural principles.

  - Rather than view an application as an enormous interconnected codebase, the application is a composition of `components` that work together to make the application work.

  - The secret sauce is how they work together.

  - We use Classes and Functions to classify functionality.

  - We require what we need.

  - We render it where we want.

  - we pay attention to `state` and react as it changes.

**React**

- We will be using React in this course to learn these basic principles.

- As a component based system, React does an awful lot for us, principally, it gets out of the way and makes it EASY to implement your application the way you see it, using familiar tools.
