## Linked Lists

### 1. What is a data structure?
- Data structures are the different ways we can organize our data.

### 2. How is a Linked List different from an array?
- Memory management, arrays must be stored as one block, while linked lists can be made of data in multiple pieces.

### 3. What is one benefit a Linked List has over an array?
- Some languages don't allow arrays to change size, so a linked list is a viable alternative in those cases.

### 4. What data does a Node hold in a doubly Linked List?
- In addition to the node's value, it holds a link to both the next node and the previous node.

### 5. What would you use to implement a Linked List data type? (object, function, class, variable…?)
- I'm a bit unclear on this question. But in the linked YouTube video, the demonstrator used classes to set up their linked list, and used integers for the data type the nodes contained.


## Vocabulary
* **Linked List**
- A sequence of nodes linked to each other.
* **Singly Linked**
- A linked list where traversal is only allowed to 'next'.
* **Double Linked**
- A linked list where traversal is allowed to both 'next' and 'previous'.
* **Node**
- A piece of data. In JS, any variable assigned a value.
* **Next**
- The next node in a linked list.
* **Prev**
- The previous node in a linked list.
* **Val**
- The value of a given node.
* **Current**
- An indication of the current position in a linked list.
* **Head**
- The first node in a linked list. 'tail' would be the opposite.
* **Circularly Linked**
- A doubly linked list where the head and tail point to each other.
* **Big-O**
- The rate at which a data structure will tax resources as it grows in size.
