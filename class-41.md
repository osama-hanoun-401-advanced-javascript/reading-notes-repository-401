## React Native

**React Native Ecosystem**

- React Native is used to create apps for Android and iOS for using React

- It's still just state and components

  - But no HTML or CSS

  - You can still "style" things using the framework guidelines

**Expo**

- Expo is the dev environment.

- Snack is an online sandbox.

- `expo-cli` is the local equivalent to `create-react-app` (you can eject).

- Running locally, you can use your own device or the official simulator

  - Only Apple users can test iPhones

  - Anyone can test android, but you need to start up an ADB from the Android Studio IDE
